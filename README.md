## Project Overview

### Purpose

Credit Card Fraud Detection System is a Machine Learning powered web application that helps financial institutions detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The system combines **supervised classification** (XGBoost) with **unsupervised anomaly detection** (Autoencoder) to provide a comprehensive fraud detection solution with explainable predictions.

### Target Audience

- **Risk Analysts:** Professionals investigating flagged transactions who need explainable fraud predictions
- **Risk Managers:** Decision-makers who need to understand fraud patterns and optimise detection thresholds
- **Data Science Teams:** Teams evaluating ML approaches for fraud detection pipelines
- **FinTech Companies:** Organisations seeking to improve their fraud detection capabilities

### Value Proposition

- Detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy using dual ML pipelines
- Understand **why** a transaction was flagged through SHAP explainability
- Optimise detection thresholds based on business cost trade-offs
- Identify novel fraud patterns that supervised models might miss

## Business Requirements

A fictional FinTech payment processing company, **SecurePay Solutions**, has been experiencing increasing losses due to fraudulent transactions. The Head of Risk Management has requested a data-driven solution to improve their fraud detection capabilities.

**BR1:** The client is interested in understanding which transaction patterns correlate with fraudulent activity, so their analysts can identify high-risk behaviours.

**BR2:** The client is interested in predicting whether a given transaction is fraudulent or legitimate, with explainable results showing why a transaction was flagged.

**BR3:** The client wants an unsupervised anomaly detection system that can identify novel fraud patterns without relying on historical labels, as a complementary approach to the supervised model.
