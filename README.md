## Business Requirements

A fictional FinTech payment processing company, **SecurePay Solutions**, has been experiencing increasing losses due to fraudulent transactions. The Head of Risk Management has requested a data-driven solution to improve their fraud detection capabilities.

**BR1:** The client is interested in understanding which transaction patterns correlate with fraudulent activity, so their analysts can identify high-risk behaviours.

**BR2:** The client is interested in predicting whether a given transaction is fraudulent or legitimate, with explainable results showing why a transaction was flagged.

**BR3:** The client wants an unsupervised anomaly detection system that can identify novel fraud patterns without relying on historical labels, as a complementary approach to the supervised model.
